# florianfmmartin's fork
The main goal I want to acheive with this fork is to use the layout evaluator to generate more ergonomic layouts based on existing ones by swapping characters in layout until the egronomic score isn't getting lower. I also want to modify the ergonomic score so that layouts generated take into account english and french 50/50 as I type both daily.
